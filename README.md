# Weed_Detection Using YOLO with Semi-Supervised Learningg
This repository has a weed detection model that uses YOLO, semi-supervised learning, and both labeled and unlabeled data. The goal is to find and locate weeds in farm fields to use less herbicide and help predict better crop yields.

# Dataset
1. Labeled Dataset: 200 images of sesame crops and weeds.
2. Unlabeled Dataset: 1000 similar images.
3. Test Dataset: 100 images with annotations. 

# Approach
The approach combines supervised learning using labeled data and semi-supervised learning using unlabeled data to enhance model performance. We applied the following techniques:
